## The efficientnet model is run under keras, please refer to the following steps:

## Model Installation:
Please refer to the following webstite:  
https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet


## Run data Preprocess:
Please use the script "Train_Test_Prep_forColor.py" to pickle the image data in dataset.  
It will generate three files including "filenames.csv", "datasets.pkl" and "datasets_split.pkl".


## Run the model:
Please run the script "ENetB5.py" after finishing data preprocess.  
Note that the "datasets_split.pkl" is needed


## Reference:
The script is revised to fit my requirement, the original script can be sourced to:

You can paraphrase it if needed!
